# CREDIT CARD FRAUD TRANSACTION DETECTION
The increase of credit card fraud is growing rapidly worldwide, which is the reason actions should be taken to stop fraudsters. The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customersâ€™ accounts.

# Machine Learning Algorithm used:
Logistic Regression

# Tools/Technologies used:
